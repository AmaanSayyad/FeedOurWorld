# Feed Our World

## Problem Statement

Hunger remains a critical global issue, affecting millions of lives daily. Factors such as natural disasters, conflicts, and inefficient food distribution systems exacerbate this problem. The current centralized food donation process often lacks transparency, accountability, and efficiency. To address this, **Feed Our World** seeks to create a more effective and transparent solution.

## Objectives

Our project's primary objectives include:

1. **Streamlining Food Donation:** Simplify and expedite the food donation process for both donors and recipients.

2. **Ensuring Transparency:** Utilize celo blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of all food donations.

3. **Promoting Community Engagement:** Encourage community involvement by allowing individuals and organizations to respond to hunger relief requests in real-time.

4. **Reducing Food Waste:** Connect surplus food with those in need, minimizing food wastage.

## How It Works

**Feed Our World** operates through the following key steps:

1. **Request Generation:** Individuals create food donation requests by capturing a photo of the needy's situation and sharing their location through the mobile application.

2. **Blockchain Recording:** Each request is recorded on the blockchain for transparency and traceability.

3. **Donor Engagement:** Donors, including travelers, NGOs, restaurants, and individuals, can review requests and provide food donations.

4. **Traceable Distribution:** The entire process is traceable on the celo blockchain, ensuring food reaches its intended recipients efficiently and accountably.

## Impact on the Blockchain Community

Our project aligns with the goals of the AI and Blockchain track by demonstrating how blockchain can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. By providing a transparent and efficient solution for hunger relief, we aim to inspire others in the blockchain community to explore similar avenues for social impact.

## Conclusion

**Feed Our World** represents the convergence of blockchain and AI for a noble cause. We're committed to making a positive and lasting impact on global hunger relief. Join us on this journey of feed our world, to make this world hunger free!

**Together, we can make a difference.**
